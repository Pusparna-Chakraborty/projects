Context

While many public datasets (on Kaggle and the like) provide Apple App Store data, 
there are not many counterpart datasets available for Google Play Store apps 
anywhere on the web. On digging deeper, 
I found out that iTunes App Store page deploys a nicely indexed appendix-like 
structure to allow for simple and easy web scraping.
On the other hand, Google Play Store uses sophisticated modern-day techniques 
(like dynamic page load) using JQuery making scraping more challenging.

Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to provide insights to better understand customer 
requirements and help developers promote their products using EDA.
